NOTE: vk.com might have updated API methods or access conditions since june 2018, when the bot was written, so there is no gurrantee that it still works.

This simple Telegram bot works locally and it's main purpose is to send reminders of your friends' birthdays 

To be more specific, bot takes friends data from user's vk.com account (no need for authentification)
It can also show friendslist, set preffered notification time etc
